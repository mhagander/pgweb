<h1>Beta/RC Releases and Development snapshots (unstable)</h1>

<p>Beta and Release Candidate packages are built prior to the release of new major versions of PostgreSQL. They are not
built continually.</p>

<p>Development snapshots are built from the latest source code and alpha/beta/rc versions that the developers are working on. These are 'bleeding edge'
versions of PostgreSQL and <font color="red"><b>should not be used in production systems</b></font> as they have had little or no testing or quality control.</p>

<p>The latest development version of the documentation is also 
<a href="/docs/devel/static/index.html">available online</a>.

<h2>One click installer</h2>

<p>One click installers are available for 32 and 64 bit Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows and 
include PostgreSQL, pgAdmin and the PL/pgSQL debugger plugin.</p>

<p>Typically only Beta and Release Candidate packages are available in the installer distribution.</p>

<p><b>Note: The one click installers do not integrate with platform-specific packaging systems on Linux. If you need
RPM packages for CentOS, Fedora or RHEL please use the packages below.</b></p>

<p>RPMs for CentOS, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are available from the 
<a href="http://yum.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Yum repository</a>.

<p>Typically only Beta and Release Candidate packages are available in the Yum repository.</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>Beta and Release Candidate tarballs are <a href="/ftp/source/">made available alongside</a> the release tarballs 
during the final phases of the development cycle of new major versions of PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Source code tarballs are built automatically every night on the official PostgreSQL development server. The 
<a href="/ftp/snapshot/dev/">development snapshot</a> is taken from the HEAD of the GIT repository, and 
includes the new features being worked on for the next release.</p>
