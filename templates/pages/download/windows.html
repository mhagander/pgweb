<h1>Windows installers</h1>

<p>
The Windows installers for PostgreSQL includes the PostgreSQL server,
<a href="http://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin III</a>; a graphical tool
for managing and developing your databases, and StackBuilder; a
package manager that can be used to download and install additional
PostgreSQL applications and drivers.
</p>

<h2>One click installer</h2>

<p>
The one click installer is designed to be as straightforward as possible
and the fastest way to get up and running with PostgreSQL on Windows.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgdownload.do#windows">Download</a>
the installer from EnterpriseDB for all supported versions.
</p>

<p>
<i>Advanced users</i> can also download a
<a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgbindownload.do">zip archive</a>
of the binaries, without the installer. This is not recommended for normal
installations, it is intended for users who wish to include PostgreSQL as
part of another application installer.

pgInstaller is a Windows Installer package that offers advanced
configuration options. pgInstaller packages are only being maintained
for PostgreSQL 8.3.
