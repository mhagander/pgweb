<h1>Linux downloads (SuSE)</h1>
<p>
PostgreSQL is available in all SuSE versions by default. However, the
SuSE "snapshots" a specific version of PostgreSQL
that is then supported throughout the lifetime of that SuSE version.
</p>
<p>
Should packages not be available for your distribution, or there are
issues with your package manager, there are graphical installers available.
</p>
<p>
Finally, most Linux systems make it easy to build from source.
</p>

<h2>Included in distribution</h2>
<p>
RPMs for SUSE Linux and openSUSE are available from the
<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</a>
in the project <i>server:database:postgresql</i>.
Platform-specific RPM packages are available for PostgreSQL
as well as a variety of related software.
Use the <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search">search facility</a>
to find suitable packages. Documentation is also available there.
</p>

<h2>Graphical installer</h2>

<p>
One click installers are available for 32 and 64 bit Linux distributions
and include PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, PL/Java and the PL/pgSQL debugger plugin.
The installer has been tested with a number of recent Linux distributions
and should work on Ubuntu 6.06 and above, Fedora 6 and above,
CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and above and others.
</p>
<p>

<b>Note: The one click installers do not integrate with
